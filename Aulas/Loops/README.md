## Loop

    It’s an infinite loop that will keep going unless you specifically request for it to stop, using the break command. Most commonly, break is used with a condition.

## While

    A while loop is similar to the loop loop except that you declare the condition that will break out of the loop up front.

## Until Loop

    The until loop is the opposite of the while loop. A while loop continues for as long as the condition is true, whereas an until loop continues for as long as the condition is false. These two loops can therefore be used pretty much interchangeably. Ultimately, what your break condition is will determine which one is more readable.

## Ranges

    Ruby lets us use something called a range to define an interval. All we need to do is give Ruby the starting value, the ending value, and whether we want the range to be inclusive or exclusive. syntax = (n..n²) or (n...n²) => this will exclude the last argument

## For Loop

    A for loop is used to iterate through a collection of information such as an array or range. These loops are useful if you need to do something a given number of times while also using an iterator.

## Times Loop

    If you need to run a loop for a specified number of times, use #times loop. It works by iterating through a loop a specified number of times and even throws in the bonus of accessing the number it’s currently iterating through.

## Upto and Downto Loops

    The Ruby methods #upto and #downto can be used to iterate from a number either up to or down to another number, respectively.
